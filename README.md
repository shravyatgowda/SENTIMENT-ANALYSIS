Description of the Task

The fourth task in the Codtech Data Analyst Internship was focused on Sentiment Analysis, a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in textual data. The primary aim of this task was to classify text (e.g., tweets, product reviews, comments) into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This process is crucial in understanding public opinion, customer satisfaction, and overall brand perception.

The task involved working with a dataset containing around 10,000 text entries, each with an associated sentiment label. The dataset chosen was large enough to capture varied linguistic patterns, slang, and mixed sentiments, making the analysis more robust and realistic.

Task Performed

1. Data Collection & Loading

- A dataset with 10,000 rows of textual data and sentiment labels was sourced and loaded into the working environment.

2. Data Preprocessing

- Cleaning text data: Removal of punctuation, numbers, and special characters.

- Lowercasing: Converted all text to lowercase to maintain consistency.

- Stopwords removal: Eliminated common but non-informative words (e.g., "the", "is", "and").

- Tokenization: Split sentences into individual words or tokens.

- Lemmatization: Reduced words to their base form (e.g., “running” → “run”).

3. Feature Extraction

- Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning models.

4. Model Implementation

- Implemented a Logistic Regression classifier to predict sentiment based on text features.

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

- Trained the model and evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Insights & Results

- The model achieved high accuracy in detecting positive and negative sentiments.

- Visualizations like word clouds were created to show the most common positive and negative words.

- Confusion matrix visualization helped understand misclassifications.

Tools Used

1. Programming Language: Python

2. Libraries:

- Pandas – Data loading and manipulation

- NumPy – Numerical computations

- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

- NLTK & SpaCy – Text preprocessing and tokenization

- Scikit-learn – Feature extraction (TF-IDF), model training, and evaluation

Editor Platform Used

The analysis was carried out in Jupyter Notebook, a widely used interactive Python environment that supports step-by-step coding, visualizations, and inline documentation, making it ideal for data science and NLP projects.

Where This Task is Applicable

Sentiment Analysis is widely used in real-world scenarios, including:

1. Business & Marketing – Analyzing customer reviews and social media feedback to improve products and services.

2. Brand Monitoring – Understanding public opinion about a brand or product in real time.

3. Political Analysis – Gauging public sentiment towards political parties, candidates, or policies.

4. Customer Support – Prioritizing negative feedback for faster resolution.

5. Market Research – Assessing sentiment trends to predict market movements or consumer preferences.

By completing this task, the ability to work with large-scale text data, preprocess it effectively, implement machine learning models, and draw actionable insights was demonstrated — a highly valuable skill set for roles in data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence.
